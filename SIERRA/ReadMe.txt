In order to build, a copy of the Sierra 68000 C Compiler needs to be located here, such that you should have the following directory structure:

depot://SIERRA/BIN
depot://SIERRA/INCLUDE
depot://SIERRA/LIB

At the time of this writing, the compiler can be downloaded here: https://segaretro.org/Sierra_68000_C_Compiler
